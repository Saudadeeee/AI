## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction
This project is designed to detect common shapes from input images using a CNN model. The workflow is as follows:
1. Receive input images from users.
2. Preprocess and normalize the images.
3. Classify the shape using the CNN model.
4. Return the prediction through a backend API.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ CNN Architecture
The CNN model is defined in [`cnn_model.py`](cnn_model.py) with the following key components:

| Layer            | Description                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Conv2d**       | 2D convolution layer for feature extraction.                |
| **BatchNorm2d**  | Batch normalization for more stable training.               |
| **ReLU**         | Non-linear activation to learn complex representations.     |
| **MaxPool2d**    | Pools features to reduce spatial dimensions.                |
| **Linear**       | Fully connected layer for final shape classification.       |

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Usage Guide

### üõ† **Overall Workflow**  
1. **Prepare images**: Input images must be in `.PNG` format.  
2. **Send images to server**: Use a `POST` request to the backend API.  
3. **Preprocessing**: The image is temporarily stored and prepared for the CNN model.  
4. **Prediction**: The CNN model classifies the shape.  
5. **Result**: The backend returns a JSON response with the predicted shape.

### üöÄ **Run the Backend Server**
```bash
python app.py
```
